# ThreadCraft E-Commerce Project

I built this project to learn and understand how full-stack development works. My goal was to cover topics like JWT, state management, cloud image uploads, endpoints, caching, routing, and more..

Tech Used: React.js, Redux Toolkit, Node.js, MongoDB, and TailwindCSS for styling.

Admin can create, edit, and delete a product. I have only one admin account, and only I can access the admin panel.
Anyone can create a user account and log in.
Guests cannot add products; you need to be logged in.
Users can add products to the cart, change quantities, and remove items from the cart dashboard.

You cannot complete an order in this project, and you won't be able to actually purchase a product. I haven't implemented the payment process yet.
